<p>The MK Hockey Hockey League was established in 2009 by Paul Taskas. Paul wanted to start a safe and affordable hockey league for players of Macedonian decent. 
The MK Hockey Leagueâ€™s aim is to provide players of all caliber a lot of ice time and a lot of fun. The league to date is comprised of 75 percent Macedonian hockey players.</p>
<p>This year we celebrate our ${yearsPlayed}th year for the MK Hockey League. 
What started out as a dare to me to revive a league for our Macedonian community has now become a great league filled with amazing talent and more importantly good people.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the boys through the years and a special thanks to Duane Rivait and The Sports Village staff for all their hard work in keeping this a great partnership.</p>`);
